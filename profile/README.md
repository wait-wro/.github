# Welcome to WAIT 🎉

**What we’re about** 🤖

We are an open community of practitioners, researchers, and enthusiasts of AI and Data Science.
We originated from the activities and experience of the Wrocław R Users Association (STWUR) - proudly continuing this work! 🏆
Anyone can join us, regardless of their level of experience.
Our mission is to educate, connect enthusiasts, and practice AI and Data Science. 🎓🤝

## Our mission is based on three pillars:

1. [**Meetups**](https://github.com/wait-wro/meetups) - On-site meetings for practitioners, enthusiasts, students, and companies that create AI solutions or want to implement them. 🗣️💡
2. **Hands-On Workshops** - (on-site/free) - Targeted at everyone who wants to expand their skillset in the technologies offered in the workshops. 🛠️📚
3. **Collaborative Projects** - Aimed at those who want to gain practical experience in Real World Data projects and those who feel the need to share knowledge or mentor newcomers. Students can work with practitioners to gain experience, while company practitioners can discover "hidden gems". Employers have the space to present their companies by delegating their engaged experts. 🌟🤝
